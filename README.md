# clustering_explainability
Unsupervised learning (clustering) that is explainable to stakeholders.

## IMM clustering
Iterative Mistake Minimization (IMM) clustering is a tree-based clustering algorithm that builds a decision tree with the same number of leaves as the number of clusters considered in K-means clustering.

## ExKMC Clustering
ExKMC is an extension of IMM by growing the trees, such that the number of leaves exceeds the number of clusters (from K-means), to achieve better partitioning.
